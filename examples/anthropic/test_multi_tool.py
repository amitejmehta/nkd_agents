    Test multi-tool orchestration: LLM chains multiple tools to complete a task.

    Key lesson: A travel assistant needs more than just flights OR hotels—it needs to
    coordinate both. Give the LLM multiple tools and it becomes an orchestrator,
    deciding which tools to use, in what order, and how to combine their results.

    The framework's agentic loop handles the complexity: tool A's output feeds into
    the decision to call tool B, then synthesize into a final answer.

    Pattern: Reuse cached client, pass tools list (required).
