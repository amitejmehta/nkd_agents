## Overview

`nkd_agents` is a minimalist Python framework for building AI agents using only the essential components: an LLM, a loop, and tools. The library is built around the philosophy of simplicity, providing a clean, type-safe way to create conversational agents that can execute tools and maintain conversation history.

## Core Architecture

The framework follows a simple but powerful architecture:

**LLM + Loop + Tools = Agent**

1. **LLM**: Handles communication with Anthropic's Claude API
2. **Loop**: Manages the conversation flow and tool execution
3. **Tools**: Async functions that the agent can call to interact with the environment
