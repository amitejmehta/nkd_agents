## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on the specific task assigned to you
2. First, read the current research report at '{{ report_file }}' to understand what's already been done
3. Update the research report with your findings using clear markdown sections and headers
4. Be thorough but concise - other agents may be working on related tasks
5. Add your findings under a clear section heading like "## Task: [Brief Task Description]"
6. Include your methodology, findings, and conclusions

## Important
- Work systematically and document your progress in the report
- Don't repeat work that's already been done
